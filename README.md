## Description

The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a personal portfolio of my work that I have done and continue to do, using React as the front-end.

### Mock Up

React

vs. basic Javascript and CSS

### Task Completed

With this project, I wanted to create a portfolio from scratch, using a React front-end interface. In this case, I am my own customer, so perfection is my own personal standard.

A portfolio of work showcases my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. As an effective portfolio, it highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Since students who have portfolios with deployed web applications are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp, it is imperitive that I have my own.

This Challenge should set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned, primarily React. The formal criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

## Installation

This project is deployed via Github Pages and Vercel. The Github Pages version contains the previous version of my portfolio, using scrap Javascript and custom CSS. The Vercel deployement displays the new and improved Portfolio with React.

### Testing the deployed site

To test the changes made for this project, you can ensure that the deployed sites are accessible to you from the deployments on Github (to the right of where you're reading this right now). Also ensure that all links work as expected, including the Resume link. The goals for this project are listed out in the acceptance criteria below. 

## Usage

This project is meant to provide an easy solution to storing all my displayable software development work. It will also be able to receive contact information with anyone trying to reach me.

## User Story and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```
